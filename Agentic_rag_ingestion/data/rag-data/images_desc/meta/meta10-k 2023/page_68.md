### Text Content Summary

1.  **Introduction to User Metrics:**
    *   The document clarifies that "Daily Active Users (DAUs)," "Monthly Active Users (MAUs)," and "average revenue per user (ARPU)" metrics generally *exclude* users from Instagram, WhatsApp, or other products unless those users also qualify as DAUs or MAUs based on their activity on Facebook itself.
    *   It emphasizes that trends in user numbers are crucial for revenue and financial performance, as they influence the number and value of ads that can be displayed. The focus is on daily and monthly active users as key engagement measures.

    *   A DAU is defined as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook via its website or mobile device, or used its Messenger application (which is also considered a Facebook user), on a given day. DAUs are also viewed as a percentage of MAUs to gauge user engagement.

3.  **Geographic Region Clarification (Note):**
    *   A note at the bottom of the page specifies the composition of the geographic regions for reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU:

### Key Insights

*   **Overall Growth:** Facebook's Daily Active Users are growing worldwide, with a significant increase from 1.929 billion to 2.110 billion over two years.
*   **Regional Contributions:** Asia-Pacific and Rest of World are the primary drivers of this growth, showing substantial and consistent increases in their DAU base. US & Canada also show steady, albeit slower, growth. Europe's DAU count remains relatively stable with minor fluctuations.
*   **Engagement Improvement (DAU/MAU):** The DAU/MAU ratio is generally increasing across all regions, indicating that a higher percentage of monthly active users are engaging with Facebook daily. This suggests improved user stickiness or engagement.
*   **Highest Engagement:** US & Canada consistently show the highest DAU/MAU ratios (around 74-75%), indicating a very engaged user base in that region.
*   **Growth in Emerging Markets:** The strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World suggests successful expansion and adoption in these regions, which are critical for future growth given the more saturated markets in North America and Europe.
