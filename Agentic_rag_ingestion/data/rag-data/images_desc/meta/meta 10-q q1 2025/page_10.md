**Text Summary:**
Daily Active Person (DAP) is defined as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp who visited at least one Family product via mobile device or web/mobile browser on a given day. DAP numbers do not include users on other products unless they qualify as DAP based on other activities on Family products. Calculations for DAP attribute multiple user accounts across products to individual people using complex techniques and machine learning models. Estimates may have a margin of error. Beginning Q4 2023, Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.
