**Text:**
- A Daily Active Person (DAP) is defined as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, "Family" products) who visited at least one product via a mobile device app or web/mobile browser on a given day.
- DAP numbers do not include users on other products unless they qualify based on other activities on Family products.
- DAP calculations estimate unique people across multiple products using complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models, involving significant judgment and internal reviews.
- Beginning in Q4'23, Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.
